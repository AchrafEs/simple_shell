Simple_Shell

In computing, a shell is a program that provides an interface between the user and the operating system (OS) kernel.
It allows users to interact with the system by entering text commands, which the shell interprets and executes on their behalf.

A shell typically includes a command-line interface (CLI) that accepts typed commands from the user
and provides feedback in the form of text output. The commands entered by the user can be simple,
such as changing directories or listing files, or complex, such as running scripts or executing programs.

There are different types of shells available in different operating systems, such as bash, zsh,
and fish on Linux and Unix systems, and PowerShell on Windows.
Each shell has its own set of commands, syntax, and features. Shells are an essential tool for system
administrators, developers, and power users who need to perform various tasks on their systems quickly and efficiently.

And in this repo we'll be trying to create our own shell.
